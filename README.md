Estimation of roots of a Quadratic Equation using Neural Networks as an application of High Performance Computing. 

The aim of the project is to replace the numerically intesive parts of a problem,in this case,finding the roots of a quadratic equation through Newton Raphson Method. 

The study of which required using a 3x5x3x1 neural network using an RMS optimizer. 3 inputs being the the three coefficients of a quadratic equation a,b, and c. Output is the required root. Approximately 150000 equations have been used for the same.
